// Description:
// Define the weight of a nonnegative integer x to be the number of bits that are set to
// 1 in its binary representation. For example, sinece 92 in base-2 equals(1011100)2, the
// weight of 92 is 4.
// 
// Write a program which takes as input a nonnegative integer x and returns a number
// y which is not equal to x, but has the same weight as x and their difference, |y - x|, is
// as small as possible. You can assume x is not 0, or all 1s. For example, if x = 6(110), You
// should return 5(011).
