Write a program that multiplies two nonnegative integers. The only operators you
are allowed to use are
    · assignment
    · the bitwise operators >>, <<, |, &, ~, ^ and
    · equality checks and Boolean combinations thereof.
You may use loops and functions that you write yourself. These contraints imply,
for example, that you cannot use increament or decrement, or test if x < y.

Hint: Add using bitwise operations; multiply using shift-and-add.
