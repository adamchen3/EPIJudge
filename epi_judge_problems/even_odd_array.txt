Your input is an array of integers, and you have to reorder its entries so that even
entries appear first. This is easy if you use O(n) space, where n is the length of the
array. However, you are required to solve it without allocating additional storage.

When working with arrays you should take advantage of the fact that you can
operate efficiently on both ends. For this problem, we can partition the array into
three subarrays: Even, Unclassified, and Odd, appearing in that order. Initially
Even and Odd are empty, and Unclassified is the entire array. We iterate through
Unclassified, moving its elments to the boundaries of the Even and Odd subarrays
via swaps, thereby expanding Even and Odd, and shrinking Unclassified.
